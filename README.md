# [Bitburner](https://bitburner-official.github.io/) Scripts

A collection of scripts that I've written for the game [Bitburner](https://bitburner-official.github.io/).

## Overview

This repository contains various scripts to automate tasks in Bitburner, including server management, hacking, and more.
These scripts are designed to help progress in the game more efficiently.

## Scripts

### Server Management

- **servers.js**: A friendly interface for managing servers. This script allows you to easily view,interact with, purchase,
  and upgrade servers on your home network.

Note: I will continue to add more scripts as I write/refine them.
